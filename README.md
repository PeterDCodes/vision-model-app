# vision-model-app
This repository is for the vision model application.

This app will be used to automate the process of training YOLO v8 vision AI models from scratch. This allows for faster creation of models and reduces the barrier of entry for project teams to leverage vision AI models in their projects.

Automated Tasks
-File and directory configuration
-YAML and training parameter set up
-Immage annotation for train/val datasets
-Final model and results delivered in single directory for users to deploy in their projects
